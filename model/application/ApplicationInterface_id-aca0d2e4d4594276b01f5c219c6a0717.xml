    documentation="Schenker is posting goods issue. This process is used when tools and spare parts are needed for a service on a turbine and are ​ delivered from main warehouse in Mutzschen&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An outbound delivery is created by Vestas if the materials are available in the stock. This outbound delivery is sent to ​Schenker by  using the IDoc DELVRY03.&#xD;&#xA;- Schenker creates a transfer order in their system based on the outbound delivery that Schenker has received. Schenker sends​ information  to Vestas that they have started the picking. This information is sent using the IDoc DELVRY03​ (Includes the qualifier PIC). ​&#xD;&#xA;- When Schenker has picked the materials they make a post goods issue. This is interfaced to Vestas’ system using the ​IDoc DELVRY03  including information regarding batches and serial numbers if the materials need this information​ (Includes goods issue qualifier PGI). ​&#xD;&#xA;- During the GI confirmation all serial No. relevant items should be consolidated by Schenker: Schenker activated ​Batch Management for the SN relevant items (1SN = 1 Batch-No.).  Because of batch split on Schenker side the consolidation is​ necessary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Link to Documentation;&#xD;&#xA;https://vestas.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/OneTool-T153PLrollout/Shared%20Documents/T15%203PL%20rollout/00%20Requirements%20and%20Process/Vestas%20-%20DB%20Schenker%20Interface.pptx?d=w8ae74256aee84e64a3c4764fa3b4d8bb&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=PhplWf"/>
